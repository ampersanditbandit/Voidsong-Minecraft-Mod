# Voidsong-Minecraft-Mod

NOTE: This mod is more of a proof of concept. I'm just one person using a really bad mod editor, so this mod may not be the best but it is the general groundwork for something I'd like to see :)

### V0.2.0 For version 1.20.1 FORGE
### V0.3.0 For version 1.21.4 NEOFORGE
It should be noted that this is a very minor
and experimental mod as it is my first. Please
report any feedback on the issues page!

# HOW TO DOWNLOAD
### For Curseforge
NEW download off of the installer! We're finally here.
### For Modrinth Modloader
Open the Modrinth app, select the mod and add it to a profile. (easiest method)

changelog:

# MINOR UPDATE
- updated to 1.21.4
