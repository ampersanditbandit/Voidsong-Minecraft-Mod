### CHANGELOG V0.1.2
# Hello again!
This version adds a few more things that are still being worked on. It's taken modrinth a bit to process the mod so I was able to work on this for a bit.

# This version adds...
## ASHEN WASTES
_"A land terrorized by the rapid industrialization of the Illagers. Nothing remains of this land except the corpses of redstone drills and production facilities."_
The Ashen Wastes is a biome that adds my first structures. Locate factories, cranes, and old drills. The factories have (very experimental) loot in their barrels, so make sure to explore. The drills may also have ores that they didn't mine.
## CONSTRUCT MOB
If you kill a Guardian (to be renamed), you can get a Guardian Heart. This heart can be used alongside a few Enshrouded Spectator blocks and Guardian Armor to create a Construct. These are neutral robots that will attack zombies for you! They are like Iron Golems, but stronger.
### Other Fixes
- Fixed cave biomes generating too often
- Added more advancements & advancement texts
- New music
- Mobs now spawn in their correct biomes
- Added the new Ashen Wood set
