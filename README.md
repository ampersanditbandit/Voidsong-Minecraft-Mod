# Voidsong-Minecraft-Mod

NOTE: This mod is more of a proof of concept. I'm just one person using a really bad mod editor, so this mod may not be the best but it is the general groundwork for something I'd like to see :)

### For version 1.20.1
It should be noted that this is a very minor
and experimental mod as it is my first. Please
report any feedback on the issues page!

# HOW TO DOWNLOAD
### For Curseforge
Make a new profile, then click on the 3 dots next to play. Select "Open Folder," then put the .jar file into the "mods" folder.
### For Modrinth Modloader
Open the Modrinth app, select the mod and add it to a profile. (easiest method)
